# Haskell List Sorting Bug

This repository demonstrates a simple Haskell program that unexpectedly fails to sort a list of numbers using the `Data.List.sort` function. The issue highlights a common pitfall in Haskell programming related to the immutability of data structures and potentially incorrect assumptions about the sorting function.

## The Bug

The original code attempts to sort a list of integers but it may not return the sorted list as expected. The solution below addresses this issue and provides a working example.

## Solution

The solution fixes the unexpected behavior, providing a clear and concise way to correctly sort a list of numbers in Haskell.
